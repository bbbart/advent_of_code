# Advent of Code
The repository contains the code for my answers to the Advent of Code programming puzzles.
Check them out at https://adventofcode.com.

It is not a beauty contest.
I always strive for readable and efficient code and tend to write a lot of documentation.
However, when it comes to solving puzzles, the relative importance of simply having a correct outcome increases significantly. :-)

## Running the code
* create the virtualenv and install the depedencies in it (`poetry install`)
* run `./run_day.py <number> [<year>]` (the default value for year is the current year)
