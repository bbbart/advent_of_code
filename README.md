# Advent of Code
The repository contains the code for my answers to the Advent of Code programming puzzles.
Check them out at https://adventofcode.com.

It is not a beauty contest.
I always strive for readable and efficient code and tend to write a lot of documentation.
However, when it comes to solving puzzles, the relative importance of simply having a correct outcome increases significantly. :-)
